# chainCMS
chainCMS is a content management system based on the steem blockchain. Our goal is to provide creators with a powerful, scalable, and cost effective tool for publishing content that can be installed on their own servers for free.

We are different from other CMS's because content and users are stored directly on the blockchain removing the need to maintain backend databases and making chainCMS extremely light weight and secure. The steem blockchain also contains a built in tipping system which can supplement or replace advertising revenue.

If you are a developer interested in joining the project, please email contact@chaincms.com.
